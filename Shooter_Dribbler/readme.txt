### ✅ **Insights into the Dribbler's Accuracy from the Code**

Based on the **code logic**, I’ll break down the key factors influencing the **dribbler's accuracy** and performance, 
including feedback mechanisms, control parameters, and potential areas for improvement.

---

### 🔥 **1. RPM Control and Accuracy**

**📌 Current Implementation:**
- The dribbler motor is controlled using **PWM signals**.  
- The **encoder feedback** measures the **real-time RPM**, which is dynamically adjusted to meet the **target RPM of 1069**.  
- The RPM calculation is based on:  
\[
                    RPM = (Encoder Count)/(Pulses per Revolution) x (60)/Time Interval (seconds)

**🛠️ How Accuracy is Maintained:**
- **Timer-Based RPM Adjustments:**  
   - The RPM is updated **every 500ms** (`timer3`), ensuring frequent corrections.  
- **Dynamic Feedback:**  
   - The duty cycle is increased or decreased in **steps of 2000** to compensate for RPM drift.  
   - This is a proportional-like adjustment (not full PID control).  
- **Quadrature Encoder Resolution:**  
   - The resolution depends on the **encoder's pulses per revolution (PPR)**.  
   - The higher the PPR, the more precise the RPM calculation will be.  

**✅ Accuracy Rating:**  
- With a PPR of **500** and a timer-based update interval of **500ms**, the RPM accuracy is expected to be within 
**±1-2%** of the target value, assuming a stable power supply and proper motor driver regulation.  
- The **accuracy** will slightly vary with motor load or resistance but remains stable due to the feedback loop.

### ⚙️ **2. PWM Duty Cycle Precision**

**📌 Current Implementation:**
- The PWM signal uses **16-bit resolution** (`duty_u16`) with values ranging from `0` to `65535`.  
- The duty cycle is adjusted in increments/decrements of **2000** during feedback correction.  
- This translates to **~3% changes** in speed per correction step:  
\[
\frac{2000}{65535} \times 100 \approx 3.05\%
\]

**🛠️ Accuracy Impact:**
- **Fine-Grained Control:**  
   - With **16-bit resolution**, the PWM duty cycle adjustments provide **fine control** over the motor speed.  
- **Potential Inaccuracy Factors:**  
   - If the motor load changes suddenly (e.g., ball resistance), the **2000-step adjustment** might overshoot or undershoot the target RPM.  
   - For **greater accuracy**, you could implement **PID control** instead of the proportional adjustment to minimize oscillation and increase stability.

**✅ Accuracy Rating:**  
- **±3% accuracy** per adjustment step due to the `2000` duty cycle increment/decrement.  
- The PWM resolution allows for **precise speed control**, but a more refined control algorithm (PID) could further enhance the accuracy.

### 🔧 **3. Encoder Reliability and Direction Detection**

**📌 Current Implementation:**
- The encoder uses **quadrature signals** (`A` and `B` channels) for **direction detection**.  
- The **Z-index** pin is optional but can provide an additional reference pulse per revolution, improving position accuracy.  

**🛠️ Accuracy Factors:**
- **Direction Detection Logic:**  
   - The code uses `if encoder_a.value() == encoder_b.value()` logic to detect the **rotation direction**.  
   - This is a simple but **reliable direction detection** method.  
- **Z-index Usage:**  
   - Currently, the **Z-index pulse** is not utilized.  
   - Adding Z-index tracking could increase the precision of RPM measurement, providing a consistent reference per revolution.  
- **Noise and Debouncing:**  
   - The code does not implement **debouncing** or noise filtering on the encoder signals.  
   - If noise occurs, it could lead to **inconsistent RPM measurements**, reducing accuracy.  
- **Encoder Resolution Impact:**  
   - With **500 PPR**, the resolution is moderate, but a higher PPR encoder (e.g., 1000 PPR) would improve accuracy.  

**✅ Accuracy Rating:**  
- **RPM accuracy ±1-2%** assuming stable encoder signals.  
- Possible noise from the encoder could introduce slight inaccuracies without filtering.

### ⚠️ **4. Encoder Sampling Frequency and Timers**
**📌 Current Implementation:**
- The RPM is updated every **500ms** using `Timer3`.  
- This gives the system time to average the pulses but may introduce slight latency.  

**🛠️ Accuracy Impact:**
- **Sampling Frequency Impact:**  
   - The **500ms timer** balances stability and responsiveness but creates a **0.5-second delay** in RPM correction.  
   - Increasing the frequency (e.g., `200ms`) would make the feedback loop more responsive and precise.  
- **Potential Drift:**  
   - If the motor speed fluctuates rapidly, the **500ms interval** may not detect and correct it immediately.  

**✅ Accuracy Rating:**  
- **±0.5-second lag** in feedback correction due to the sampling interval.  
- Faster sampling intervals would improve RPM tracking accuracy.

### 🔥 **5. Limit Switch and IR Sensor Precision**

**📌 Current Implementation:**
- The dribbler relies on **limit switches** and an **IR sensor** to control movements and stop the motor when necessary.  
- Both limit switches and the IR sensor are checked every **100ms** using timers.  

**🛠️ Accuracy Factors:**
- **Timer Frequency:**  
   - The **100ms polling frequency** is sufficient for detecting mechanical stops.  
   - This ensures the motor stops **quickly** when the dribbler reaches its limit, improving safety and reliability.  
- **IR Sensor Reliability:**  
   - The IR sensor is used to detect the ball.  
   - The **100ms check** ensures timely response, but **ambient interference** (e.g., sunlight) could affect IR accuracy.  
- **No Debouncing on Switches:**  
   - The limit switch inputs are not **debounced**, which may cause false triggering.  
   - Adding a **software debounce** (e.g., `20ms delay` after a switch trigger) would improve accuracy.

**✅ Accuracy Rating:**  
- **±100ms accuracy** in ball and limit switch detection.  
- May occasionally misfire due to lack of debounce filtering.

### 🔥 **6. Suggested Improvements for Accuracy**

✅ To **improve the dribbler's accuracy**, consider the following enhancements:
- **PID Control for RPM:**  
   - Replace the proportional-like adjustment with a full **PID control loop** for **precise RPM regulation**.  
   - This will reduce oscillations and make the RPM correction smoother.  
- **Faster RPM Sampling:**  
   - Reduce the RPM update interval to **200ms** instead of `500ms` for faster feedback correction.  
- **Encoder Noise Filtering:**  
   - Add a **software filter** or debounce logic to prevent signal noise from affecting RPM readings.  
- **Use the Z-index Signal:**  
   - Utilize the **Z-index pulse** from the encoder for a consistent reference point per revolution, improving RPM consistency.  
- **Debounce Limit Switches:**  
   - Add a **debouncing mechanism** (e.g., `20-30ms` delay) to prevent false triggers from the limit switches.
